# Challenge 9: Sliding Menu ðŸªŸ

### Menu Structure

- Create a slide-out menu panel that opens from the right side.
- The panel should contain at least four menu items.
- Maintain a clear navigation hierarchy for easy usability.
- Include a header/title at the top of the menu panel.
- Add a close button in the top right corner of the menu.

### Interaction Features

- Implement a toggle button to open the menu.
- Clicking the close button should dismiss the menu.
- Clicking a menu item should:
  - Show an alert message indicating which item was clicked.
  - Automatically close the menu.
- Clicking outside the menu should also close it.
- Ensure the menu is fully hidden when closed (not partially visible).

### UX (User Experience)

- Implement smooth transitions for menu opening and closing.
- Ensure no content shifts when the menu opens or closes.
- Provide clear visual feedback on interactions (e.g., hover effects).
- Use proper cursor indicators for clickable elements.
- Prevent scrolling issues when the menu is open.
