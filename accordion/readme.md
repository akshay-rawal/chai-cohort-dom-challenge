### Accordion Structure

- The container should display multiple collapsible sections.
- Each section should consist of a header and a content area.
- Only one section should be open at a time.
- Sections should be visually separated for clarity.

### Section Headers

- Headers should function as clickable buttons.
- Each header should display:
  - Section title on the left.
  - A dropdown arrow (▼) on the right.
- Headers should have hover effects for better interaction.
- The arrow should rotate when a section is opened.

### Content Display

- The content should be hidden by default.
- When opened, the content should appear with a fade-in animation.
- Content styling should be distinct from the headers.
- The content area should adjust dynamically to the text length.

### Interaction Behavior

- Clicking a closed section should:
  - Open that section.
  - Close any previously open section.
  
- Clicking an open section should:
  - Close that section.
- At any time, only one section can be open.
